            <p id="details">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording
                light, either
                electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
                photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and
                business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes,
                hobby, and mass communication.
